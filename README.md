# Fruit and Vegetable Image Recognition

## Overview

This project focuses on building a model to classify images of fruits and vegetables. The project uses a dataset of images of 36 different types of fruits and vegetables. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify these images.

## What the Project Does

This project develops and trains a machine learning model capable of identifying 36 different types of fruits and vegetables from images. It utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to extract features from images and make accurate predictions.

## Why the Project is Useful

This project has several practical applications:

- **Automated Grocery Checkout:** The model can be integrated into self-checkout systems to automatically identify fruits and vegetables, speeding up the checkout process.
- **Inventory Management:** Retailers can use the model to track inventory levels of fruits and vegetables by automatically analyzing images of shelves.
- **Dietary Tracking:** The model can be incorporated into apps that help users track their food intake and nutritional information.
- **Agricultural Applications:** Farmers can use the model to identify diseases or pests in crops based on image analysis.
- **Educational Tool:** The project serves as an educational tool for learning about deep learning and image classification.

## Analysis Conducted

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    - Images of fruits and vegetables were loaded from the dataset.
    - Images were resized and normalized to prepare them for the model.
    - Labels were numerically encoded for use in the model.

2. **Model Building:**
    - Two models were built and compared:
        - A custom CNN model inspired by VGG16.
        - Transfer learning with MobileNetV3 large.
    - The Keras library was used for model creation and training.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    - The models were trained on the training data and evaluated on the validation data.
    - Performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the model's performance.
    - Confusion matrices and classification reports were generated to identify specific areas where the model performed well and areas needing improvement.

4. **Heatmap Generation:**
    - VGG16 was utilized to generate activation heatmaps for incorrect predictions. 
    - This visualization technique helps in identifying areas of the image that the model focuses on for classification, improving model interpretability and identifying potential areas for improvement.

## Insights
